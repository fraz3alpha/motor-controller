# Motor Controller - v1

This is version 1. There is always going to be newer versions, and this particular one is a big learning experience

## History

Back in the late 90s I attempted to build a DC motor controller to handle the mobility-scooter motors I had in the garage, destined for my entry for Robot Wars, but it never got any further than trundling to the end of the road. This project attempts to pick up where I left off now that I have been re-invigorated by the return of Robot Wars to the BBC in 2017.

## Concept

I have been inspired, as least partially, by Charles Guan of http://www.etotheipiplusone.net, who was bitten by the motor controller bug a while back, and has been coming up with some great pstuff on his blog.

My board is targetting 100A at about 36v so that I can easily run the 1000/800W 24/36v scooter motors available on eBay and through other outlets - nominally for mini electric scooters and quads, but mainly I'm just aiming to have fun.
